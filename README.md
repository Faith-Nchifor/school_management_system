# A school mangement application
The idea of this project is to build an application for school management. A lot of things have changed in cameroon ever since the crisis started. Physical attendance is often a challenge in the english speaking regions of the country. Most schools turn to whatsapp to give announcements, notes and lectures. However this is not a good option due to the disctracting nature of whatsapp. The purpose of this project is  to create a school management system to serve as an effective platform.
